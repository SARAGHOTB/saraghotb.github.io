        <p class="aboutme">
          I am currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca" >Universit√© de Sherbrooke</a> Working on low temperature quantum
          materials. I work under supervision of prof Patrick Fournier and under the advisement of Prof Louis Taillefer and Prof Claude Bourbonnais
        . As my PhD project, I work on <a href="LP.html">Little Parks effect</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project involves the measurement of the charge q of the
          supercurrent carriers in unconventional superconductors, more
          specifically the electron-doped cuprates. The Little- Parks experiment
          measures the resistance of a nanoring close to its transition
          temperature as a function of applied magnetic field. It is used to
          detect resistance oscillations as a function of the magnetic field
          with a single field period set by the size of the ring and the charge
          of the supercurrent carriers. For conventional superconductors, the
          charge is always q = -2e for the electron pairs. However, there are
          theoretical models predicting different values for superconducting
          copper-oxygen materials (cuprates) in different doping regimes. Up to
          now, at optimal doping with the maximum critical temperature, the
          existing measurements with YBa2Cu3O7 nanorings have also shown q =
          -2e. Since our expertise lies rather in Pr2-xCexCuO4, the
          electron-doped cuprates, we propose to explore the Little-Parks effect
          on this material as a function of doping. 
          During my PhD journey I worked with many different devices such as <a href="Posts.html">PPMS, PLD, SQUID, AFM, XRD, Photolithography and RF sputtering</a>.
          

        
        <h3><a href="Posts.html">A Daily Dose of Physics</a></h3>
        <p>
          In this page I post some physics concepts which I have worked on or the concepts that I find interesting.
          Most of the topics are categorized as a condensed matter physics. Here are some example of the topics which I post on daily dose of physics.
