      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I am currently a PhD candidate in condensed matter physics and I work with superconducting material in a cool laboratory.
          In my free time, I love to paint read. I like digital <a href="paintings.html">painting</a> and also I have some experience in oil paining and drawing. 
          I am also a bibliophile and I never get tired of reading. My taste in reading is pretty wide. I am  mostly interested in 18th and 19th literature as well as graphic novels, self help books and poetry and basically 
          any good book that bring me to a new world of imagination. It's been almost three years that I post review about the book that I read
          on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104257290-sara-ghotb" target="_blank"> Goodreads</a> and I try to put my most favorite books in this page.
          On my free time I learnt a bit of HTML and CSS and I built this webpage with my basic knowledge on web development, I am learning every day and I will try to update and upgrade the page.

    <h2>My journey to become a data scientist!</h2>
    <p>Physicists deal with data, which makes them natural data scientists. I became more and more interested in the field as I worked with date in experimental field.
      So I took different courses and tried to improve my knowledge on programming and data and I am still learning. I post my experience on data science journey in <a>here</a>.
